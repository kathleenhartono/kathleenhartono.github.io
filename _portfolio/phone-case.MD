This 3D-printed TPU phone case protects devices while allowing access to buttons and a personalizable Polaroid holder. Its parametric design also makes for easy adjustments if phone models change.

## Key Features

* **Protective and Flexible Design**  
TPU material provides resistance to drops while maintaining flexibility for easy installation. There is a 1.8 mm thickness to ensure protection without bulk.

* **Button and Screen Accessibility**  
Extrusions on the sides allow full access to buttons, ring/silent switch, and screen. A 1.0 mm lip protects the screen when placed face-down.

* **Personalizable Polaroid Holder**  
The case includes a three-sided Polaroid holder, keeping photos secure while allowing easy insertion and removal.

* **Parametric Modeling**  
Parametric design enables quick adjustment of dimensions for fit, improving the prototyping process and iterations.

* **Optimized Printing Settings**  
Printed with TPU (PolyFlex™ TPU95) using elastic settings for layer adhesion, print speed, and temperature to ensure better quality results.
