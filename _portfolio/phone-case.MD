This 3D-printed TPU phone case protects devices while offering functional access to buttons and a Polaroid holder for personalization. It balances flexibility and protection, and its parametric design allows easy adjustments for different phone models.

## Key Features

* **Protective and Flexible Design**  
TPU material provides shock absorption while maintaining flexibility for easy installation. A 1.8 mm thickness ensures protection without bulk.

* **Button and Screen Accessibility**  
Extrusions on the sides allow full access to buttons, mute rocker, and touchscreen. A 1.0 mm lip protects the screen when placed face-down.

* **Polaroid Holder for Personalization**  
The case includes a three-sided Polaroid holder, keeping photos secure while allowing easy insertion and removal.

* **Parametric Modeling for Iteration**  
Parametric design enables quick adjustment of dimensions for fit, improving prototyping speed and final product accuracy.

* **Optimized Printing Settings**  
Printed with TPU (PolyFlex™ TPU95) using elastic settings for layer adhesion, print speed, and temperature to ensure high-quality results.

* **FFF Printing Advantages and Limitations**  
The case leverages Fused Filament Fabrication, offering fast prototyping and customization, while accounting for minor surface imperfections and anisotropic material properties.
